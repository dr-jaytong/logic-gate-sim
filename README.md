# A GPU Accelerated Gate-Level Simulator

This repository is my reimplementation of my gate-level simulator that I developed during my doctoral thesis, which is used for accelerating [mutation](https://doi.org/10.1109/ASQED.2013.6643604) and [fault](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2013.34) simulations on GPUs.
I will be reimplementing this using modern C++ and CUDA. Support for other vendors GPUs will be included in the future.

Stay tuned for more updates.
